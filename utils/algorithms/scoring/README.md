# Message Scoring System

This directory contains the implementation of our advanced message scoring system for evaluating the quality and relevance of AI-generated responses.

## TODO: Implement Scoring System

  - Create validation suite

## Implementation Priority
1. Core statistical metrics (BLEU, ROUGE)
2. BERT embeddings and semantic scoring
3. METEOR implementation
4. Reference-free metrics
5. Hybrid approaches
6. System optimizations
7. Testing and validation

## Dependencies
- TensorFlow.js for BERT embeddings
- WordNet for synonym matching
- Stemmer for word normalization
- Universal Sentence Encoder
- RoBERTa models (optional)

## Performance Considerations
- Cache embeddings for frequently used text
- Implement lazy loading for large models
- Use batch processing for multiple evaluations
- Optimize memory usage for large-scale scoring

## Usage Guidelines
1. Choose appropriate metrics based on task
2. Consider context window size for coherence
3. Balance accuracy vs. performance
4. Use ensemble methods for robust scoring
